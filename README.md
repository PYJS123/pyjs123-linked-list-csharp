This isn't actually something you're meant to use- you could, but I would recommend just using the default `LinkedList` available by default in C#.
I just did this to practice my C# and reinforce my understanding of how linked lists work.
You can take a look inside.

## My code
you can use a foreach loop on this linked list!
nothing else much which stands out though
